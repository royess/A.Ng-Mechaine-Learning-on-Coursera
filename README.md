The project consists of the solutions of all homework of Ng A.'s Machine Learning course.
The directories named "machine-learning-ex1" to "machine-learning-ex8" are written in OCTAVE/MATLAB, as the course suggests. And I have accomplished them with the instructions and code framework the course provided.

I'm also doing some small experiments on it, e.g. to modify some models or to change some parameters and see how the result'll differ from the origin work.

P.S. In another project, I'll recode some exercises in Python. I think it will be fun to compare the computational cost using the two languages.
